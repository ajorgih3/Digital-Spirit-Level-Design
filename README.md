# What is this project? 
Our group was assigned to make a peripheral that will allow for an application where simple notes will be generated for a duration of time. Our digital spirit level uses the input of the DE-10 Lite accelerometer to create a level-dependent audio output. The peripheral is coded in VHDL with the use of state machines while the instructions sent into the peripheral are coded using ASSEMBLY.
